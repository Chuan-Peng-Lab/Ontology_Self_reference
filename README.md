# Ontology of Self-Reference in Neuroimaging

Our ontological dataset is derived from neuroimaging studies on self-reference. The literature was systematically searched up to November 1, 2023, following a standard protocol. Compiled by two independent coders, our dataset offers standardized data on self-referential behaviors and neural responses. It includes CSV files detailing operational aspects in neuroimaging studies of self-referencing, BrainMap formatted data of brain regions activated by self-reference, and associated codebooks.

## Data Description
There were a total of 4,054 participants in the database, of which 2,406 were women, 2,993 were healthy, and 1,061 were sick.
There are 118 articles in the database, of which 73 are in version 1 and 45 are in version 2.

## Version History
**Version 3 - 2024.01.22**
- Updated the self-referencing database (last article screening date: November 1, 2023) to include children and participants with psychiatric disorders.
- Revised the Codebook to record disease information of the affected subjects.

**Version 2 - 2022.11.28**
- Updated the self-reference database for adults, excluding diseases.
- Added meta-analysis results of normal subjects.

**Version 1 - 2022.07.25**
- Uploaded operational definition CSV files for the self-reference database.
- Uploaded article information CSV files for the self-reference database.

## Software Used
- Articles were stored in Endnote and analyzed using R and Matlab R2018B (Versions 1- Version 2).
- Articles were stored in Zotero and analyzed using Matlab R2021A (Version 3).
