# Ontology_Self_reference
Our ontological dataset originates from neuroimaging studies on self-reference. Literature was systematically searched up to 1 November 2023, following a standard protocol. Compiled by two independent coders, the dataset encompasses standardized data on self-referential behaviors and neural responses. It includes CSV files detailing operational aspects in neuroimaging studies of self-referencing, BrainMap formatted data of brain regions activated by self-reference, and associated codebooks.
