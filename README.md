# Ontology of Self-Reference in Neuroimaging

Our ontological dataset is derived from neuroimaging studies on self-reference. The literature was systematically searched up to November 1, 2023, following a standard protocol. Compiled by two independent coders, our dataset offers standardized data on self-referential behaviors and neural responses. It includes CSV files detailing operational aspects in neuroimaging studies of self-referencing, BrainMap formatted data of brain regions activated by self-reference, and associated codebooks.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses the following details:
- Total number of articles
- Age distribution of subjects
- Gender distribution of subjects
- Healthy subjects
- Subjects with illnesses
- Countries of study participation

## Version History
**Version 3 - 2024.01.17**
- Updated the self-referencing database (last article screening date: November 1, 2023) to include children and participants with psychiatric disorders.
- Revised the Codebook to record disease information of the affected subjects.

**Version 2 - 2022.11.28**
- Updated the self-reference database for adults, excluding diseases.
- Added meta-analysis results of normal subjects.

**Version 1 - 2022.07.25**
- Uploaded operational definition CSV files for the self-reference database.
- Uploaded article information CSV files for the self-reference database.

## Software Used
- Articles were stored in Endnote and analyzed using R and Matlab R2018B for Versions 1 and 2.
- For Version 3, analysis was performed with Ginger ALE and Matlab R2021A.
